                                       <strong>Why Digital Marketing and how it can be one of the career prospects?</strong><br>
                                       Let’s just think of an instance , say about 20-30 years ago. During those days, Internet was not so famous or was not available for many. Only one out of ten would be using the internet due to the cost of installation or frequent network problems. And for advertising any product one needs to use offline methods like Radio Marketing, TV ads, newspaper ads or ads in magazines, etc, which are more expensive and time consuming too.

                                      Those days are gone. The Internet is available at your fingertips. Just with one click you can get the content and product details or service information of any company or business organization. Nowadays, usage of the internet is not just restricted to a computer system alone, but mobiles, tabs, pads and so-on. So the concept of digital marketing has also changed with the diverse use of the internet.
