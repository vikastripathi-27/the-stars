                                       MS-Excel is a commercial spreadsheet application produced and distributed by Microsoft Windows and Mac-OS. It has a characteristic of performing the basic calculations, graphing tools, creating pivot tables and creating macros This application performs very effectively on arithmetic solution.<br>
                                       Time to be the expert in excel: Pursuing this course you will be enabled with understanding of advanced formulas, tools, mechanism from a basic spreadsheet program and then a lively and effective analytic tool. Whereas many other train for simple formulas, I prefer to go through contextual examples.<br>

At the last students will be expert in writing robust, formulas and features from scratch all this will take you to build dynamic tools and excel display, and judging. Making your own formula based formatting norms. Targeting dates, schedules, and arrays.

                                       Tally is popularly known as an accounting software for small and medium businesses. It does all the functions of accounting that a particularly mid sized business has. This is the view of most of the persons who know about Tally. But Tally does much more than that. Tally is not just an accounting software. After the release of ERP version of Tally, the capability and functioning of Tally is much more widened and extended to a great extent.<br>

For example (I give this example often to various people) did you know that you maintain Employees information in Tally? Right from his/her name to everything about duties, work, profile, groups and so on. This is could be a great feature if a business has a number of employees working in the business.

                                       Goods and service tax or GST subsumed most of the indirect taxes. It has brought us to the “One nation one tax” regime.
Accounting under GST is more simple compared to the erstwhile VAT and excise. However, one must understand and pass accounting entries in the books of accounts regularly. Learn about the different accounting entries that need to be passed under GST.

The best food at my doorstep, the best deal on my laptop and the best education for my future. With this trend, we see the employers also want the best candidates.The individuals who are smart with good communication skills and have the ability to take risk are always in demand. Communication skills is a very important tool and a well spoken prospect who can communicate confidently in English and articulate well to his peers, stands a better chance to progress in his career and achieve his goals.

We spend years and years on learning subjects in the curriculum. In our practical life, we only use 20% of this knowledge. However, if we spend few hours and put some efforts in training ourselves on how to speak meaningfully, we can change our life.

    Do we speak like we want others to understand us?
    Do others understand exactly what I mean?
    Do I communicate well or do I communicate effectively?

Effective communication was the key, is the key and will always remain the key to success. Therefore, use this key and open the doors to success….today!

                                       Let’s just think of an instance , say about 20-30 years ago. During those days, Internet was not so famous or was not available for many. Only one out of ten would be using the internet due to the cost of installation or frequent network problems. And for advertising any product one needs to use offline methods like Radio Marketing, TV ads, newspaper ads or ads in magazines, etc, which are more expensive and time consuming too.

                                      Those days are gone. The Internet is available at your fingertips. Just with one click you can get the content and product details or service information of any company or business organization. Nowadays, usage of the internet is not just restricted to a computer system alone, but mobiles, tabs, pads and so-on. So the concept of digital marketing has also changed with the diverse use of the internet.
